# Institution and Branch APIs - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the institution and branch APIs that have been implemented for the Smart Queue System.

## Implemented APIs

### Institution Types (6 endpoints)
1. **GET** `/api/v1/institution-types` - Get all institution types
2. **GET** `/api/v1/institution-types/{institution_type_id}` - Get institution type by ID
3. **POST** `/api/v1/institution-types` - Create new institution type
4. **PUT** `/api/v1/institution-types/{institution_type_id}` - Update institution type
5. **DELETE** `/api/v1/institution-types/{institution_type_id}` - Delete institution type

### Institutions (6 endpoints)
1. **GET** `/api/v1/institutions` - Get all institutions
2. **GET** `/api/v1/institutions/{institution_id}` - Get institution by ID
3. **POST** `/api/v1/institutions` - Create new institution
4. **PUT** `/api/v1/institutions/{institution_id}` - Update institution
5. **DELETE** `/api/v1/institutions/{institution_id}` - Delete institution
6. **GET** `/api/v1/institutions/all` - Legacy endpoint (backward compatibility)

### Branches (6 endpoints)
1. **GET** `/api/v1/branches` - Get all branches
2. **GET** `/api/v1/branches/{branch_id}` - Get branch by ID
3. **GET** `/api/v1/institutions/{institution_id}/branches` - Get branches by institution ID
4. **POST** `/api/v1/branches` - Create new branch
5. **PUT** `/api/v1/branches/{branch_id}` - Update branch
6. **DELETE** `/api/v1/branches/{branch_id}` - Delete branch

## Total: 18 API Endpoints

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Requirements Met
- [x] Get institution by ID
- [x] Get all institution types
- [x] Get branches by institution ID
- [x] Get all branches
- [x] Get branch by branch ID
- [x] Delete branch
- [x] Delete institution by ID
- [x] Update branch
- [x] Update institution by ID
- [x] Create institution (separate from branch creation)
- [x] Create branch (requires valid institution ID)

### ✅ Additional Features
- [x] Create, read, update, delete institution types
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Proper validation (branch creation requires valid institution ID)
- [x] Dynamic crowd count calculation
- [x] Legacy endpoint for backward compatibility
- [x] UUID generation for all new records
- [x] Proper relationship maintenance

### ✅ Data Models
- **InstitutionType**: InstitutionTypeId, InstitutionType
- **Institution**: InstitutionId, InstitutionTypeId, AdministratorId, Name, InstitutionDescription
- **Branch**: BranchId, InstitutionId, Name, BranchDescription, Address, ServiceHours, ServiceDescription, Latitude, Longitude, Capacity

### ✅ Response Models
- All endpoints return properly structured JSON responses
- Include related data (institution types, administrators, branches)
- Include calculated fields (totalCrowdCount)
- Proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Complete Setup
1. Create institution type
2. Create institution (using institution type ID)
3. Create branches (using institution ID)

### Retrieving Data
- Get all institutions with their branches and related data
- Get specific institution by ID
- Get all branches for a specific institution
- Get all branches across all institutions

## Validation Rules
- Branch creation requires a valid institution ID
- Institution creation is separate from branch creation
- All IDs are automatically generated as UUIDs
- Proper foreign key relationships are maintained

## Error Handling
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid data or missing required fields
- 404 Not Found: Resource not found
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server-side errors

## Testing
A comprehensive test script (`test_institution_apis.py`) is provided to verify all endpoints work correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Add authentication and authorization
2. Add input validation and sanitization
3. Add pagination for large datasets
4. Add filtering and sorting capabilities
5. Add bulk operations
6. Add audit logging
